	abstract = {In the present study, we have further explored implicit self-esteem in currently depressed individuals. Since suicidal ideation is associated with lower self-esteem in depressed individuals, we measured both implicit and explicit self-esteem in a population of currently depressed (CD) individuals, with and without suicidal ideation (SI), and in a group of non-depressed controls (ND). The results indicate that only CD individuals with SI show a discrepancy between their implicit and explicit self-esteem: that is, they exhibit high implicit and low explicit self-esteem. CD individuals without SI exhibit both low implicit and low explicit self-esteem; and ND controls exhibit both normal implicit and normal explicit self-esteem. These results provide new insights in the study of implicit self-esteem and the combination of implicit and explicit self-esteem in depression.},

	abstract = {Previous work has highlighted the importance of uncertainty in motivating social comparison. We extended this approach by focusing on the frequency of social comparisons and four uncertainty-related constructs, namely, self-concept clarity, intolerance of uncertainty, anxiety, and depression. Participants were 166 undergraduates who completed measures for each construct, as well as measures of their own frequency of general, upward, and downward social comparisons. Initial correlational analyses indicated that higher self-concept clarity was related to a lower frequency of general and upward social comparisons; whereas higher intolerance of uncertainty was related to a higher frequency of general, upward, and downward social comparisons. Depression and anxiety were also related to increased general and upward comparisons. Of particular interest, however, were the ﬁndings associated with two path analyses. The ﬁrst analysis indicated that when all four uncertainty-related constructs were considered together, intolerance of uncertainty emerged as the most important predictor of general, upward, and downward comparisons. In contrast, lower self-concept clarity and increased depression played a much more limited role, and anxiety was not a signiﬁcant predictor. In turn, the second analysis showed that self-concept clarity and intolerance of uncertainty fully mediated the relationships between depression, anxiety, and general and upward social comparison.},

	abstract = {Background: There is emerging evidence to suggest that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for depression may have a secondary effect on self-esteem, but less is known about non-CBT based interventions. To examine this, we had two main aims; (1) to meta-analyze psychotherapy effects on (i) depression and (ii) self-esteem, and (2) to investigate the relationship between reductions in depression symptoms and improvements in self-esteem. Design: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized control trials of psychotherapy for adult depression, which included a self-esteem outcome at post-treatment. Nineteen studies with a total of 3423 participants met the inclusion criteria. For each comparison between psychotherapy and a control condition, we calculated Hedges' g both for depression and self-esteem and pooled them in two separate metaanalyses. Furthermore, meta-regression was used to explore the association between the effect of psychotherapy for depression and its effect on self-esteem.
Results: The effects on depression were large and significant (Hedges' g = 0.95; [95 \% CI: 1.27, 0.63]). We found evidence of smaller, albeit still moderate, effects on self-esteem (Hedges'g = 0.63; [95 \% CI:0.32, 0.93]), with sustained effects at 6–12 months (Hedges'g = 0.70; [95 \% CI: 0.03, 1.43]). We also found a strong inverse association between the effects of psychotherapy for depression and self-esteem (β = 0.60, p {\textless} 0.001). Limitations: Heterogeneity was very high (I2 = 97 \%), and out of 19 trials, only 6 trials were rated as having a low risk of bias.
Conclusions: The results suggest that psychotherapy for depression may improve self-esteem to a moderate degree.},

	abstract = {Background. Cognitive theory points to the importance of negative self-schemas in the onset and maintenance of depression and anxiety disorders. Hereby, it is important to distinguish between automatic and explicit self-schemas, reﬂecting diﬀerent cognitive-motivational systems. This study tested whether patients with a current major depression and/or anxiety disorder are characterized by automatic self-anxious and self-depressive associations and whether these associations are disorder speciﬁc.
Method. Patients (n=2329) and non-clinical controls (n=652) were tested as part of The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, a multi-center, longitudinal, cohort study with patients from diﬀerent health care settings. Patient groups and non-clinical controls (18–65 years of age) were compared with regard to automatic self-anxious and self-depressive associations measured with the Implicit Association Test.
Results. Individuals with an anxiety disorder showed enhanced self-anxious associations, whereas individuals with a depression showed enhanced self-depressive associations. Individuals with co-morbid disorders scored high on both automatic self-associations. Although remitted individuals showed weaker automatic self-associations than people with a current disorder, their automatic self-anxious/depressed associations were still signiﬁcantly stronger than those of the control group. Importantly, automatic self-associations showed predictive validity for the severity of anxious and depressive symptoms over and above explicit self-beliefs.
Conclusions. This study represents the ﬁrst evidence that automatic self-anxious and self-depressive associations are diﬀerentially involved in anxiety disorders and depression. This may help to explain the refractoriness of these disorders and points to the potential importance of automatic self-associations in the development of psychopathological symptoms.},

	abstract = {Implicit self-esteem (ISE) has been considered a critical factor in the development and maintenance of major depressive disorder (MDD). Further investigating the event-related potential (ERP) characteristics underlying abnormal ISE in MDD would be helpful for understanding the neural mechanism of MDD. For this purpose, 32 MDD patients and 31 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) was used to evaluate explicit self-esteem (ESE), and a self-esteem go/no-go association task (GNAT) was used to assess ISE. Electroencephalograms were synchronously recorded when performing the self-esteem GNAT. Behavioral data and ERP characteristics under different conditions were analyzed and compared within and across groups. The results showed that compared to HCs, MDD patients had signiﬁcantly lower RSES scores and self-D scores of GNAT, which reﬂected lower levels of ESE and ISE, respectively. No signiﬁcant correlation was found between RESE and self-D scores, and only RESE scores were signiﬁcantly negatively correlated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score. The averaged centroparietal go-P3 amplitude under the self-positive condition was signiﬁcantly smaller in MDD than in HCs. Moreover, HCs had a signiﬁcantly larger average centroparietal goP3 amplitude in self-positive than in self-negative conditions, while this pattern was opposite in the MDD group. The neural activity patterns for other conditions were similar between MDD and HCs. Our results suggested that patients with MDD have a decreased level of both ESE and ISE, and ISE might be more independent of clinical symptoms. Decreased neural processing that implicitly associate self with positive conditions (and relatively increased implicit association between self and negative conditions) might be important neural correlates for abnormal ISE in MDD.},

	abstract = {The present study was conducted to explore the associations between explicit self-esteem (ESE), implicit self-esteem (ISE), ESE/ISE discrepancies, depression severity, suicidal ideation (SI), and suicide risk among patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). To this end, 36 MDD patients with SI, 35 MDD patients without SI, and 32 healthy controls were recruited. All participants were interviewed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), and they also completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation-Chinese Version (BSI-CV) and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (SES) were used for the analysis. Further, the Implicit Association Test (IAT) was conducted to assess participants’ ISE. The study revealed significant differences in ESE among the three groups, F(2, 90) = 44.88, p {\textless} .001. In particular, the group of MDD patients with SI had the lowest score. The interaction between the size and direction of ESE/ISE discrepancy was associated with depression severity, β = .50, p = .004, and SI, β = .39, p = .045. Among the four types of self-esteem, individuals with diminished self-esteem had the highest SI score whereas individuals with low congruent self-esteem had the highest suicide risk score. Based on these findings, the study suggested that diminished self-esteem could help in the early detection of depression and SI. Low-congruent self-esteem may also be considered a screening factor for suicide risk.},

	abstract = {Background: The signiﬁcance of implicit self-schema and other-schema in major depressive disorder (MDD) is highlighted by both cognitive theory and attachment theory. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) characteristics of implicit schemas in MDD patients.
Methods: The current study recruited 40 patients with MDD and 33 healthy controls (HCs). The participants were screened for mental disorders using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale-14 were employed to assess the clinical symptoms. Extrinsic Affective Simon Task (EAST) was conducted to measure the characteristics of implicit schemas. Meanwhile, reaction time and electroencephalogram data were recorded.
Results: Behavioral indexes showed that HCs responded faster to positive self and positive others than negative self (t = −3.304, p = 0.002, Cohen’s d = 0.575) and negative others (t = −3.155, p = 0.003, Cohen’s d = 0.549), respectively. However, MDD did not show this pattern (p {\textgreater} 0.05). The difference in otherEAST effect between HCs and MDD was signiﬁcant (t = 2.937, p = 0.004, Cohen’s d = 0.691). The ERP indicators of self-schema showed that under the condition of positive self, the mean amplitude of LPP in MDD was signiﬁcantly smaller than that in HCs (t = −2.180, p = 0.034, Cohen’s d = 0.902). The ERP indexes of otherschema showed that HCs had a larger absolute value of N200 peak amplitude for negative others (t = 2.950, p = 0.005, Cohen’s d = 0.584) and a larger P300 peak amplitude for positive others (t = 2.185, p = 0.033, Cohen’s d = 0.433). The above patterns were not shown in MDD (p {\textgreater} 0.05). The comparison between groups found that under the condition of negative others, the absolute value of N200 peak amplitude in HCs was larger than that in MDD (t = 2.833, p = 0.006, Cohen’s d = 1.404); under the condition of positive others, the P300 peak amplitude (t = −2.906, p = 0.005, Cohen’s d = 1.602) and LPP amplitude (t = −2.367, p = 0.022, Cohen’s d = 1.100) in MDD were smaller than that in HCs.
Conclusion: Patients with MDD lack positive self-schema and positive otherschema. Implicit other-schema might be related to abnormalities in both the early},

	title = {Questioning the vulnerability model: {Prospective} associations between low self-esteem and subsequent depression ratings may be spurious},
	abstract = {Background: According to the vulnerability model, low self-esteem makes people more depressed. Support for the vulnerability model comes almost exclusively from analyses using cross-lagged panel models, showing a negative effect of initial self-esteem on subsequent depression ratings when adjusting for initial depression. However, it is well known that such adjusted effects are susceptible to regression toward the mean.
Methods: Data from four waves of measurements in five different samples (total N = 2703) were analyzed with two different cross-lagged panel models, two different random intercept cross-lagged panel models, and two different latent change score models, predicting change forwards as well as backwards in time.
Results: High initial self-esteem predicted both decreased and increased depression ratings between measurements and an increase in self-esteem between measurements predicted a concurrent decrease in depression ratings. Limitations: Only data from two western countries, Switzerland and USA, were analyzed. Whether the main finding, that a prospective effect of self-esteem on subsequent depression ratings might be spurious, applies to other countries and cultures remains an open question.
Conclusions: Due to the incongruent results, any causal effect of self-esteem on depression ratings, and thus the vulnerability model as such, cannot be corroborated by the data and models analyzed here. Instead, we propose, tentatively, that prospective associations between self-esteem and depression ratings may be spurious due to a combination of reasons, including regression toward the mean. The indication that depression might not be affected by measures to improve individuals' self-esteem is of clinical relevance.},

	abstract = {Identifying clinically relevant predictors of depressive recurrence following treatment for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is critical for relapse prevention. Implicit self-depressed associations (SDAs), defined as implicit cognitive associations between elements of depression (e.g., sad, miserable) and oneself, often persist following depressive episodes and may represent a cognitive biomarker for future recurrences. Thus, we examined whether SDAs, and changes in SDAs over time, prospectively predict depressive recurrence among treatment responders in the CAN-BIND Wellness Monitoring for MDD Study, a prospective cohort study conducted across 5 clinical centres. A total of 96 patients with MDD responding to various treatments were followed an average of 1.01 years. Participants completed the Depression Implicit Association Test (DIAT) – a computer-based measure of SDAs – every 8 weeks on a tablet device. Survival analyses indicated that greater SDAs at baseline and increases in SDAs over time predicted shorter time to MDD recurrence, even after accounting for depressive symptom severity. The findings show that SDAs are a robust prognostic indicator of risk for MDD recurrence, and that the DIAT may be a feasible and low-cost clinical screening tool. SDAs also represent a potential mechanism underlying the course of recurrent depression and are a promising target for relapse prevention interventions.},
