Statistical analysis of NPI-40, HNSS, and PNI-S individually

Since this thesis project is branching off of a larger project from my PI, there are many measures in the 
battery that will not be used in my thesis. These three as well as the Charisma, Self Deception Enhancement
Scale, CNI, Collective Self IAT, GASP, and Power measures are a part of the parent study but not analyzed as
a part of my project.
