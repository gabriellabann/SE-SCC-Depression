#| label: writing results into .csv
```{r}
write_csv(wave1_cohort1_clean, "Wave1_Cohort1_Scored_Measures.csv")
```

In total, `r nrow(wave1_cohort1_clean)` participants completed the measures.

```{r results='asis'}
papaja::apa_table(
  wave1_cohort1_clean %>% select(CESD_Total, RSE_Total, IAT_Score, Depression_Level) %>% head(),
  caption = "Summary of Psychological Measures")
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
