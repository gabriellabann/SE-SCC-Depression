# Intrapersonal Interplay between Depressive Symptoms and Self-Esteem: Connection with Self-Concept Clarity"
shorttitle: "Depression and Self-Esteem

This project investigates the relationship between depressive symptoms with self esteem and self concept clarity.

I am evaluating a multivariate relationship between implicit and explicit 
self-esteem (SE), depressive symptoms, and self-concept clarity (SCC). 

Research question: In this current study, we aim to evaluate the relationship between implicit and explicit 
SE with depressive symptoms. We also aim to evaluate the temporal stability of explicit SE, implicit SE, 
and SCC among healthy adults across three points in time: baseline, one-week past baseline, and two-weeks 
past baseline. Our aim is that outlining these relationships will lay the groundwork for the investigation 
of potential treatment options for depressive symptoms.
