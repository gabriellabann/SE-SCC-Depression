# SE-SCC-Depression
# Mini-project: Skeleton repo

# This project will both function as a mini-project and
# as a jumping off point for my thesis research

# In terms of the thesis project, I am evaluating a 
# multivariate relationship between implicit and
# explicit self-esteem (SE), depressive symptoms, and 
# self-concept clarity (SCC).
