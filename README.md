# SE-SCC-Depression
Mini-project: Skeleton repo

This project will both function as a mini-project and
as a jumping off point for my thesis research

In terms of the thesis project, I am evaluating a 
multivariate relationship between implicit and
explicit self-esteem (SE), depressive symptoms, and 
self-concept clarity (SCC). 
Research question: In this current study, we aim to evaluate the relationship between implicit and explicit 
SE with depressive symptoms. We also aim to evaluate the temporal stability of explicit SE, implicit SE, 
and SCC among healthy adults across three points in time: baseline, one-week past baseline, and two-weeks 
past baseline. Our aim is that outlining these relationships will lay the groundwork for the investigation 
of potential treatment options for depressive symptoms.
